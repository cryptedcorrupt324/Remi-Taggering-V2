      <h1>Welcome to Remi Taggering V2</h1>
      <p>
        Built for fans of fast-paced, hand-powered movement, Remi Taggering V2 is a competitive tagging game where your only way to move is with your arms. Swing, climb, vault, and launch yourself through wild arenas as you chase down other players — or do everything you can to avoid getting tagged.
        <br><br>
        Inspired by the movement madness of Gorilla Tag, this fangame cranks up the speed, competition, and pure adrenaline. Whether you're juking your friends with slick wall climbs or crashing into them mid-air for the perfect tag, every match is a sweaty, shout-filled race to stay in the game.
